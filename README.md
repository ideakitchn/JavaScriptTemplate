jsTemplate - my personal template for JavaScript
==================================================

This is a self executing anonymous functions template that I use for JavaScript templates.
It's based off a talk given by [Elijah Manor](http://www.elijahmanor.com/) at [MIX 11](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/OPN08) Hope you enjoy it.
